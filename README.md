## Caused difficulties and took a lot of time:

1. The scroller could not be indented;
2. There were some problems with fonts (I'm using Ubuntu, decided to not load SF Pro fonts, because it violates the license);
3. There were problems with customization of checkboxes and plus icons. It was impossible to export svg from the sketch; They had to be implemented via css, it took some time figuring that out;

In General, I've spent about 4-5 hours on this task. I hope you like it. I'm looking forward to your feedback.
The most time consuming part was figuring out and implementing the UI designes. I've worked with sketch before, but we were just exporing and slicing the png images. I think that I've spent about 3-3.5 hours on the UI.
